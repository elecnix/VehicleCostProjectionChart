Vehicle Cost Projection Stacked Bar Chart Specification

Purpose
This application generates a stacked bar chart showing the projected costs of owning a single vehicle over the next 10 years. The chart will help assess when the annual costs of keeping the vehicle are high enough to consider replacing it with a new electric vehicle. The costs considered are:

Fuel (gasoline or electricity)
Maintenance and repair costs (increase with vehicle age)
Opportunity cost (the cost of keeping the vehicle instead of investing its market value)
Each year in the future will show these three costs, discounted to present value.

Variables Provided by User
The user will input the following data:

Initial Purchase Price (P): Amount paid for the vehicle.
Current Vehicle Age (A): The number of years the vehicle has been in use.
Kilometers Driven Annually (K): How many kilometers the user drives per year.
Average Fuel Consumption (F): Liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km).
Current Market Value (M): Current value of the vehicle (optional; default is calculated based on depreciation).
Maintenance Cost by Vehicle Age (MC): Function or array of maintenance costs per year of vehicle age (e.g., $500 for a 5-year-old vehicle, $1000 for a 10-year-old vehicle).
Fuel Price (FP): Price per liter of gasoline or electricity cost per kilometer for an electric vehicle.
Discount Rate (r): Opportunity cost of money if it were invested (typically 10%).
Calculations

1. Fuel Costs (FC)

Annual fuel cost based on kilometers driven and fuel consumption:

    FC = (K * F / 100) * FP

Where:

K = kilometers driven annually
F = fuel consumption (liters per 100 km)
FP = fuel price (per liter of gas or cost of electricity)

2. Maintenance Costs (MC)

Maintenance costs depend on the vehicle's age. The user provides a function or list that defines maintenance costs for each year of vehicle age. The program will calculate the cost for each future year by adding to the current vehicle age:

    MC = MaintenanceCostByAge[A + t]

Where:

A = current vehicle age
t = year offset from current (0 to 10)

3. Opportunity Cost (OC)

The opportunity cost is the foregone earnings if the user were to invest the vehicle's current market value instead of keeping it. Assume a 10% return on investment annually:

    OC = M * r

Where:

M = current market value of the vehicle (depreciates annually)
r = discount rate (opportunity cost, typically 10%)

If the current market value is not provided by the user, it can be estimated using a straight-line depreciation method or a custom depreciation function.

4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

Each year's costs (fuel, maintenance, opportunity) must be discounted to their present value to account for the time value of money:

    DCF(t) = C / (1 + r)^t

Where:

C = cost in year t (fuel, maintenance, opportunity cost)
r = discount rate (10%)
t = number of years from now

The total discounted cost for each year is the sum of the discounted fuel, maintenance, and opportunity costs:

    TotalCost(t) = DCF(FC) + DCF(MC) + DCF(OC)

Output: Stacked Bar Chart

The program should generate a stacked bar chart with the following:

X-axis: Years (0 to 10)
Y-axis: Discounted total costs in dollars (current value)
Bars: Each bar represents one year and is divided into three segments:

Fuel Costs (discounted)
Maintenance Costs (discounted)
Opportunity Cost (discounted)

Example Chart Layout (ASCII)

Year 1:  |||||||||||
Year 2:  ||||||||||||||
Year 3:  |||||||||||||||||
Year 4:  |||||||||||||||||||||

Each year shows how the total ownership costs evolve, allowing the user to see when future costs become large enough to justify switching to a new vehicle.

Assumptions
The user will sell their current vehicle to buy a new one (Tesla Y), so opportunity costs are based on market value.
Insurance costs are excluded in this prototype.
Depreciation is modeled as a linear function unless the user provides a custom depreciation model.
Formula Summary (ASCII Text)
Fuel cost per year:
    FC = (K * F / 100) * FP
Maintenance cost per year (depends on vehicle age):
    MC = MaintenanceCostByAge[A + t]
Opportunity cost per year:
    OC = M * r
Discounted costs for each year:
    DCF(t) = C / (1 + r)^t
Total cost for each year:
    TotalCost(t) = DCF(FC) + DCF(MC) + DCF(OC)
This spec should allow a developer to build the first prototype of the cost analysis chart.
